# Getting Started

## Install and launching R packages

The code chunk below uses p_load() of pacman package to check if tidyverse packages are installed in the computer. If they are, then they will be launched in R.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse)
```

## Importing the data

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

# Plotting a simple bar chart

```{r}
barplot(table(exam_data$RACE),
        main = "Distribution by Race",
        xlab = "Race Category",
        ylab = "Count",
        col = "grey")
```
